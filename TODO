* Try different classifiers: svmsgd, vowpal wabbit, SVM with polynomial kernel

* Try with and without example balancing

* Might also be useful to normalize the query words, based upon their frequency (for the l2 prior)

* Try with and without case sensitivity

* It might be useful to try a different l2 penalty for each class,
but there just doesn't seem to be enough data.

* 11 dev examples isn't very much, we should average across different dev splits.
